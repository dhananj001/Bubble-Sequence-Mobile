[Play Now on Netlify 🌐](https://bubblesequence.netlify.app/)

Bubble Rush (previously "Bubble Sequence") is a fun and addictive game for kids (and adults!) built using **plain JavaScript**. The goal is simple: **pop the bubbles in ascending order** before time runs out. But with smooth animations, iPhone-style UI, sound effects, level selection, and even PWA support — it's more than just a bubble game!

---

## 🎮 How to Play

- Tap the bubbles in **ascending number order**.
- Each tap triggers an **arrow animation** hitting the bubble.
- Finish the level quickly to earn **3 stars**, average time for **2 stars**, and slower completion gets **1 star**.
- **Fail the level** if time runs out or sequence is broken.
- You can **retry** failed levels and continue the sequence on success.
